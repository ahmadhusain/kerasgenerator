`kerasgenerator` package is shipped with some data generator functions, which are designed to make the data generation process for [`keras`](https://keras.rstudio.com)' model easier.

## Installation

The package is in early development stage and currently only available via GitHub. You can install the development version using `install_github()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Install the development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("bagasbgy/kerasgenerator")

```

## Further Development

* Support for generating data from **file in specified path**
* Data generator for **k-shot learning** model fitting
