`kerasgenerator` contain some data generator functions which designed to make the data preparation process for [`keras`](https://keras.rstudio.com)' [`fit_generator()`](https://keras.rstudio.com/reference/fit_generator.html) easier.

# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("bagasbgy/kerasgenerator")
```

## Further Development

- Support for generating data from **file in specified path**
- Support for incorporating [`recipes`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/) package for **data preprocessing**
- Data generator for **k-shot learning** model fitting
